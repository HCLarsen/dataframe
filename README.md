# Dataframe

**NOTE:** This is a Github placeholder repo for the project's true repo on Gitlab. You can raise issues using this repo, but all code will be found [here](https://gitlab.com/HCLarsen/dataframe)

The Dataframe shard allows programmers to work with and manipulate data in a dataframe (or dataset) object. Information can be easily imported or exported in CSV format, modified by column, filtered by row, or even combined with other Dataframe objects.
